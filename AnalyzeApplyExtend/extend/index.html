            <div class="box sticky">

                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>you use the sticky element whenever you want a element, image, etc to always be in the same spot no matter the size of the platform.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box relative">

                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>You use the relative property when you want the element close to its original position.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box fixed">

                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>The fixed position should be used when you want to have a particular element in the same spot every time.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box absolute">

                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>Use the absolute position when you want an element to be relative to its first position.</p>
